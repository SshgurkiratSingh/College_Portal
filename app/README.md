# Authentication Implementation

This document explains how authentication has been implemented in the application.

## API Routes Authentication

All API routes are now protected with authentication checks. This is done using:

1. A `requireAuth()` utility function that verifies the user's session
2. Proper error responses (401 Unauthorized) when authentication fails
3. Try-catch blocks to handle errors gracefully

Example implementation in an API route:

```typescript
import { requireAuth } from '@/app/utils/requireAuth';

export async function GET(request: Request) {
  // Check if user is authenticated
  const authResult = await requireAuth();
  if (!authResult.authenticated) {
    return authResult.response;
  }
  
  // Continue with the authenticated request...
}
```

## Page Authentication

Pages that require authentication are protected at multiple levels:

1. **Server-side protection**: Using server components to redirect non-authenticated users
2. **Client-side fallback**: Using the `ProtectedPage` component for client-side protection
3. **Middleware**: Using Next.js middleware to catch protected routes

## Authentication UI

When a user tries to access protected content without authentication:

1. They are redirected to the home page with an auth=required parameter
2. A yellow notification is shown explaining authentication is required
3. Login/Register buttons are displayed for easy authentication

## Middleware Protection

The middleware (`app/middleware.ts`) provides an additional layer of protection for both API routes and page routes.
